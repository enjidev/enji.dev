## Full-time Work

**Ciptaloka** (Jul 2016 - Jun 2021)

My first and (currently) only professional work is at Ciptaloka. At Ciptaloka, I do many types of work, such as developing desktop, mobile, and web applications.

However, my work there is primarily focused on web development, and around the last 2 years I worked there, I have learned a lot about React, particularly when creating the v2 design editor.

Here are the details of the work I did at Ciptaloka:

- Created the v2 design editor layout using React.
- Redesigned the website's front page from vanilla CSS to use Foundation 6.
- Developed interactive UI on mobile editor using Framework7, Backbone.js, and Marionette.js.
- Created e-mail marketing design templates using Foundation for E-mails.
- Customized the blog.ciptaloka.com WordPress theme to match the looks and feels of the main site.
