One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

### Support Device

With my trusty **iPad Pro M1 11" (2021)** as my backup work companion, I've the freedom to work from anywhere.

Its powerful performance and long battery life ensure that productivity knows no bounds, whether I'm at a coffee shop or exploring remote locations.

It also helps me perform comprehensive **compatibility** checks for websites on the Safari browser, which is exclusive to Mac devices.

## Display

The dual monitor setup maximizes my web development workflow. I can code on one screen while previewing live on the other — no more <span class="text-xs"><Kbd>Alt</Kbd> + <Kbd>Tab</Kbd></span> necessary for faster, more efficient work!

Need a website with extra wide breakpoint? I've got you covered with my monitor.
