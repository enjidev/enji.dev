One of the most important things for me when working from home is having the right tools. So, let's start with my main device - the computer.

## Computer

| Name       | Detail                       |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| OS         | Windows 11 Home 64-bit       |
| Proccessor | Intel Core i3-12100 12th Gen |
| RAM        | 32GB 3600Mhz DDR4            |
| GPU        | RTX 3060 12GB GDDR6          |
| Storage    | NVMe M.2 1TB Gen4x4          |

This computer may not have the latest specs, but it runs incredibly fast and smooth! It's perfect for web development, even for larger or heavier projects.

The 32GB of RAM also ensures that multitasking is a breeze!

### Support Device

With my trusty **MacBook Pro M2** as my backup work companion, I've the freedom to work from anywhere.

Its powerful performance and long battery life ensure that productivity knows no bounds, whether I'm at a coffee shop or exploring remote locations.

It also helps me perform comprehensive **compatibility** checks for websites on the Safari browser, which is exclusive to Mac devices.

And I have an **iPad Pro M2** with an Apple Pencil as well. With a large 12.9" display size, it gives me the space I need to create detailed and expressive artwork!

I also have an iPhone, which comes in handy for checking website compatibility specifically on Safari mobile.

## Display

The dual monitor setup maximizes my web development workflow. I can code on one screen while previewing live on the other â€” no more <span class="text-xs"><Kbd>Alt</Kbd> + <Kbd>Tab</Kbd></span> necessary for faster, more efficient work!

Need a website with extra wide breakpoint? I've got you covered with my ultrawide monitor.
